Game Description:
    You are a dot.
    You can move in a 2D-plane.

    You need to avoid enemies.
    Enemies chase you, or else move in an obstucting pattern.
    Touching an enemy reduces your health.

    You need to move onto targets.
    Touching targets reduces their health.
    If their health is 0, you earn points or similar.

    From time to time, a few action points(APs) appear.
    APs need to be touching in a specific order to be triggered.
    Interacting with APs triggers special events, such as damaging all enemies or giving bonus points.


    Every level consists of a number of Entities (enemies, targets, and APs).
    Every level has a goal.
    Achieving this goal completes the level.
